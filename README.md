# PokeApp
Pokedex

# NOTES
- The filter by pokemon name is having issues because i couln't finish de cancel pokemon data on cell reuse, so when you filter the cell can load info from a previous pokemon URL.
- Some code looks repeated but my way of thinking was, i prefer to have something that looks similar and do not create early abstractions, for example the API calls  and the API ERRORS are pretty similiar because it is easier to abstract this later when you have the full picture of what the app is doing than doing it on the go.

Pokedex

# NOTES
- The filter by pokemon name is having issues because i couln't finish de cancel pokemon data on cell reuse, so when you filter the cell can load info from a previous pokemon URL.
- Some code looks repeated but my way of thinking was, i prefer to have something that looks similar and do not create early abstractions, so i prefer to have some code in the API or the ERRORS similiar because it is harder to abstract this later when you have the full picture than doing it on the go!.
